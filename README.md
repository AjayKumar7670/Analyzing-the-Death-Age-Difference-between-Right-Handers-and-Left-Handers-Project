# Analyzing-the-Death-Age-Difference-between-Right-Handers-and-Left-Handers-Project
The project "Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers" utilizes age distribution data and statistical analysis techniques to investigate the claim of early death for left-handers. The project employs pandas and Bayesian statistics to explore the probability of being a certain age at death based on reported handedness.  
Through the analysis, several observations can be made. The scatter plot reveals the age distribution for both right-handers and left-handers, allowing for visual examination of any patterns or trends. The examination of mean left-handedness over birth years provides insights into the changing rates of left-handedness over time.  
The calculation of probabilities based on handedness and age of death enables a deeper understanding of how left-handedness may relate to mortality rates. By comparing the overall probability of left-handedness in the population and the probability of age at death given left-handedness or right-handedness, we can evaluate any potential differences or associations between handedness and age of death.
